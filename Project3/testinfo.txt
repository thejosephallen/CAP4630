The attributes, constraints, and preferences used to test my recommender system are below:
The instance consists of several variables relevant to the average restaurant dining
experience. These variables are represented as the attributes listed below. The constraints
that follow represent money-losing relationships among these variables that the 
restaurant has picked up on and has taken measures to control. The statements to the side
of the constraints are equivalent to those on the left and are a bit easier to read. The 
preferences beyond that contain a pair of variables and a preference rating that signifies 
how important the relationship between the two variables is to a particular customer. For 
example, the customer describes by this instance would be quite upset about not having fish 
and wine.
