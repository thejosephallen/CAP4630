Instructions to use this program:

1) Make sure that the Clasp-3.3.2 executable is runnable by the operating system as "clasp".
	- This involves renaming the executable file and adding it to the system path.
2) If you decide to load data from files, make sure that they are in the same directory as the
source code.
	- If you enter data manually, temporary files "a.txt", "c.txt", and "p.txt" will be
	created in the current directory for use by the program.
	- Testing files "attributes.txt", "constraints.txt", and "preferences.txt"
	will be available for your use.
3) To run the program simply execute the main.py script and make use of the GUI that pops up
to enter the data.
	- There are options to load data from files or enter it manually. If you decide to
	enter it manually, press the Help button to see accepted data formats.
	- The program will print information to your system console.
4) The time required to compute preferences increases exponentially as the number of 
attributes increases, so have patience if the program takes a couple seconds.
	- A calculation progress bar will let you know how long it is taking.
